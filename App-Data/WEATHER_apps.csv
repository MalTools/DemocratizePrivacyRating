io.kodular.amenendez891.Despertador,Free online alarm clock,WEATHER,Free online alarm clock with rooster sound 🐓,"Online alarm clock with rooster sound: a clock designed for the user to indicate what time he wants the app's online alarm clock to wake him up with the sound of a rooster.

With our digital alarm you will always make it to appointments, no longer use computer alarm clocks or a bedside alarm clock. Use an online alarm clock and control your time.

The idea that an alarm clock (usually acoustic) set the desired time comes from ancient times. According to legend, the creator of the first alarm clock: which consisted of a water clock equipped with a whistle (made by displacing the air contained in a reservoir at a certain moment), must have been Plato (around 400 BC). In ancient medieval China, fire clocks with alarm clocks were used: the burning of a thread caused a decrease in the weights on a metal tray. Modern mechanical alarm clocks became widely used in the 19th century.

The basic task of such clocks is to wake people up from sleep, but alarm clocks are also applied to remember an event. To stop the sound, press the ON / OFF button in the app. Some models of alarm clocks stop automatically after a few minutes. This application will be playing until you stop it by pressing the button. Classic alarm clocks have a pointer that is used to set the alarm time, in this app, when you click on set the time, a clock will appear where you can set an alarm at 6:30 for example or set an alarm at 5 30.

Traditional alarm clocks make a sound using a mechanical or electronic device, but newer ones can use a different alarm. Simple, battery-powered devices play tunes. Other models can imitate singing, laughing or speaking sounds. Some are equipped with a radio that activates the currently selected station.

In recent times, computer programs and websites have been developed that replace alarm clocks. Similar functions also have various electronic devices, for example: mobile phones, televisions or stereo mini music channels."

RadarMetAlert is an automatic weather alert app based on radar images provided by the Civil Protection. RadarMetAlert will identify you on the map and, once activated the notification system, every 10 minutes will analyze the meteorological situation in the surrounding area and will notify you of any heavy showers nearby. If the intense storm cell is more than 15km away, the notification will be silent, and if it is closer to your position, it will also send a sound notification.
RadarMetAlert notifies only particularly strong or extreme thunderstorms.
Once you have activated the notifications, you can overshadow the app and let the active service in the background take care of periodically checking the weather situation. If a storm cell is detected nearby, a notification will be sent with the distance between you and the storm; you can then view the radar image by reopening the app to check its precise position.

The calculations of this app are based on radar images of the Civil Defense which are updated on average every 10 minutes.

The App also has a News section where you can view the synoptic map of Europe and the latest weather bulletin published by the Air Force, as well as the meteomont and avalanche bulletin, the LIST OF TERREMOTI INGV calculated on your GPS position and much more.

It is also possible to send your GPS position quickly via SMS or by using the copy paste in the social network that you use the most.

com.vwebtech.ramzantable2,Ramzan Time Table 2021,WEATHER,Ramzan is the Islamic holy month of fasting by Muslims worldwide.,"Ramzan or Ramadan 2020
Ramzan is the Islamic holy month of fasting by Muslims worldwide.

Although worshipping Allah or God, can be done at any time during the year and no special day is ear marked for this, but still every religion has set about a particular date and time for fasting and prayers so that it can bring about maximum benefit to the one observing the fast or praying. This is because one needs to be reminded to thank the Lord and not forget His innumerable blessings bestowed upon us, in our daily hustle-bustle of house hold tasks or earning of livelihood. We need to take out time to thank Him for giving us the gift of life, for the breath that sustains life, for the food we eat etc.Also, while praying we should hope that when our life finally comes to an end, and His angels come to take us away from this Earth, we are granted paradise. But, it is not easy to appease the Lord-He too, likes to test His disciples. Only those who please Him with their devotion are granted His mercy.

And so, in Islam, Allah is worshipped in the Holy month of Ramzan. Ramzan or Ramadan is the special month in which followers of Islam regularly do the ‘Namaz’ and keep the rigorous fast called ‘Roza ‘in which not a drop of water is consumed for straight 12 hours. Although people keep fast in other religions too, but during Ramzan, the Muslims keep this strict fast for 30 continuous days. At the end of 30 days, only after the moon is sighted, is the fast broken"

Also added is a simple regular app where you can control the animation speed.

Adding a widget to the home screen varies depending on the phone model or version of the Android operating system. Regardless, the process is usually as follows:
(1) long press the home screen;
(2) choosing to add widgets;
(3) the Precipitation Radar Image widget is transferred from the list to the home screen;
(4) entering initial widget settings.

The regular app contains ads in the bottom menu bar. Ads can be removed with an in-app purchase.

The source of the animation of the precipitation radar image is the Environment Agency of the Republic of Slovenia (ARSO):
http://meteo.arso.gov.si/met/sl/weather/observ/radar/
The Slovenian National Meteorological Service measures precipitation over Slovenia and its immediate surroundings with two weather radars at Lisca and Pasja level. The composite radar image shows the distribution and intensity of precipitation measured every 5 minutes. The measurement time is given in Universal Coordinated Time UTC; the corresponding official time in Slovenia is one hour (in winter) or two hours (in summer) longer."

***********************

“Baba” – hag, gammer or simple a… woman. Popular in 80’s and 90’s cuckoo clock-style home meteo was surprisingly trustful way to say what’s the weather going to be like. Whenever “baba” was showing up, umbrella was a must-have accessory. When hidden though, you should expect a decent weather. Less about the science behind, probably close to “weather rock”, this old style meteo had an undeniable advantage of showing localised, almost personal, weather forecast. 
Inspired by the idea of local weather forecast “Meteo Baba” gives you an opportunity to run weather forecasting model powered by modern AI technology, with retro flavour, directly on your phone!

Internet connection is not required to run the model however, if you are not sure about current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity or air pressure you have a possibility to retrieve them, inside the app, from internet or read your device’s sensors. Afterwards, you will be still able to manually modify the readings to reflect your location reality. Enjoy the app!

com.starpath.marinebarometer,Marine Barometer,WEATHER,Designed for mariners,"Marine Barometer is a barometer sensor interface that is uniquely designed to meet the needs of mariners who rely on accurate atmospheric pressure for weather routing and the evaluation of weather maps. Pressure readings can be manually saved permanently along with the latitude, longitude, and time of the reading. If a sensor offset has been applied, that value is also stored with each recorded pressure. These recorded pressures can then at the navigator's convenience be transferred to the vessel's printed logbook. 

The GPS sensor is accessed for latitude and longitude only. The elevation of the sensor (your iOS device that includes a barometer) above sea level must be entered manually. Elevation values from the GPS are not accurate enough for the intended application.

A sliding average of the pressure displayed over the past 14 seconds can be engaged to account for the change in sensor height in the presence of waves and swells at sea so that an accurate sea level pressure can be obtained.

The concept of sea level pressure is explained along with how it is determined from the sensor reading.

Instructions are provided on how to check the calibration of the sensor, and a sensor offset can be applied as needed. Links to sources of accurate sea level pressure are included.  Sources of accurate elevation are included for use on land.

The standard units for marine applications are millibars (mb) or hectoPascals (hPa). The main pressure display can also be set to inches of mercury, millimeters of mercury, or kiloPascals. However, because the primary reference pressures that would be used to check the sensor calibration are in mb, the sensor calibration must be set using millibar units. 

Reference links are provided for learning more about the tactical use of pressure for weather forecasting and weather map evaluation. Discounts are offered for barometer related reference books."

Research is directed towards problems of national concern and involves multidisciplinary teams with emphasis on both short-term and long-term solutions to improving animal production and product quality.

Stress brought on by climate conditions is a problem of national concern regarding improvements toward animal production. The Heat Stress application is a tool that can help mitigate this concern. Heat Stress forecast maps are made using the seven day forecasts of four weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - National Weather Service (NWS).

With the use of the Heat Stress forecast maps a user can see if their animals might be in a heat stress prone area before any animals incur heat stress. Along with using the forecast maps manually, a user can create and manage up to five locations. Each location gives the user current and forecasted data that are relevant to preventing heat stress. The five locations are also able to notify the user in advance if their saved locations are prone to heat stress. Alerts are customizable by the user, allowing them to select how far out they would like to be notified and their preferred time of notification."

com.github.the_salami.nowcasting,MAPLE Nowcasting,WEATHER,Short-term rain/snow forecasts from McGill University's MAPLE Nowcasting service,"PLEASE NOTE: The Nowcasting service has been out of service for several months now due to issues with the source data. As a result, this app currently does not work. For updates on this situation, you can check McGill's official Nowcasting website at https://radar.mcgill.ca/imagery/nowcasting.html.

The data used by this app to provide forecasts is only available for Southern Ontario, Québec, and the northeastern United States.

You already have plenty of great weather apps that give forecasts for the coming days or weeks. This simple app has a single purpose: it tells you what kind of precipitation you can expect at your location (or others you choose) over the next three hours, accurate to the neighbourhood level. Want to know if you can go for a run or a bike ride in the next couple hours, but worried about those dark clouds in the distance? Check the nowcast!

How does it work? Researchers at McGill University developed an algorithm called MAPLE (McGill Algorithm for Precipitation Nowcasting by Lagrangian Extrapolation) that uses past radar imagery and wind directions to predict the motion of rain and snow storms. The university calculates this data every 20 minutes for the next three hours and provides it to the public on the web, free of charge - see the link in the notice above.

com.qasim.qaus,سبب ظهور قوس قزح -Rainbow,WEATHER,The reason for the appearance of a rainbow in the form of an arc,"The reason for the appearance of the rainbow, or what is also known as the arc of colors or the rainbow, is one of the natural physical phenomena that occur due to the passage of light rays in raindrops and their refraction and decomposition within them.
Interpretation of the rainbow phenomenon in the sky in winter, and it is formed when the light rays falling from the sun are refractory at an oblique angle inside the raindrops. Its reflection over a wide range of angles with an increase in the concentration of the reflection occurring at the angle of 40 degrees, and the angle of 42 degrees.
The reason for the appearance of a rainbow in the sky in the event that the eye sees a rainbow, this means that it is located in a direction opposite to the direction of the solar rays, in addition to the occurrence of a conical angle between the horizon line and the points on the rainbow, and this angle is 42 degrees and is known as the angle of the rainbow. Visibility is 84 degrees.
The reason for the appearance of the rainbow after the rain is formed when the sun’s rays and rain meet together in a very precise way, so the sun’s rays separate into colors that are seen in the rainbow, because they enter the raindrops, and the sun’s rays are composed of different colors that we often do not see, when the ray descends from the sun to The earth is formed white, but if the ray collides with the drops at a certain angle, then the different colors form to form the rainbow.
Interpretation of the rainbow phenomenon The theory that explains the division of white light into a group of colors when it passes through a triangular piece of glass called a prism was discovered by the famous scientist Isaac Newton in 1666 AD; The group of these colors forms the rainbow in a specific order, starting with red, then orange, then yellow, then green, then blue, then indigo, then violet, where the rainbow appears after rainstorms; As a result of the atmosphere being filled with raindrops."

- particle pollution (also known as particulate matter, including PM2.5 and PM10)
- carbon monoxide
- sulfur dioxide
- nitrogen dioxide
Most of the stations on the map are monitoring both PM2.5 and PM10 data, but there are few exceptions where only PM10 is available.

The AQI is divided into six categories. Each category corresponds to a different level of health concern. Each category also has a specific color. The color makes it easy for people to quickly determine whether air quality is reaching unhealthy levels. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern.

Use your voice to request METAR and TAF for a particular airport, city or nearest airport  (U.S. only currently).

Usage instructions:

On an active watchface, say ""ok Google, start Airport Weather"". Alternatively you can use one of the available launchers to launch Airport Weather application on your Wear device (not the handheld!) or choose Airport Weather from the start or recents menu.

It will launch the app and display the main menu. 

You can choose between Search, Nearest, manually input ICAO or domestic code or 5 most recent successful searches.

If you choose ""Search"", you can then say the airport name (e.g. ""Palomar Airport"") or city name (e.g. ""San Diego""). 
""Nearest"" option will display weather for the closest airport within 25 miles.

The result will come back as an actionable notification with current color-coded flight rules (VFR, IFR, etc) if a single airport was found or the worst flight rules if multiple airports were found. 

You can then click on the notification to see the full decoded weather card. If several airports are found, you can scroll the cards vertically.

If you swipe left (scroll to the right) on a METAR card, it will show you decoded TAF for that airport if available, or nearest TAF within 25nm from that airport. All standard US TAF features are supported, excluding parameters specific to military airports. However, it does handle military TAFs properly (converts kilometers to statute miles, etc).

Please be prepared to wait up to a minute if your search was too broad.

com.unifish,UniFish Weather,WEATHER,The most complete weather app made for anglers!,"Why did we make this app?

As avid anglers ourselves we constantly use weather apps to plan and guide our fishing sessions. Our team has been using a multitude of apps for years from many different countries, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. At some point we thought: ‘’How cool would it be if we could combine the best features out there in one simple to use app’’? Not only that, it would also need to cover most of Europe so that when you travel abroad on your fishing adventures you could rely on the same quality features you’ve gotten accustomed to. This is exactly what we did! After 3 long years with a team of weather specialist, incredible developers and some of the most experienced anglers in Europe we pulled it off. 

Our app has now:

- Industry beating radar forecast for the better part of Europe, including the Scandinavian countries and the UK. It shows you exactly how the precipitation event is going to develop over the next two hours. Depending on the terrain accuracy varies from 0-10 minutes. This is the most accurate rainfall forecast possible in the world. When you go fishing never get caught out in the rain anymore.

- Numerical weather forecasting that is accurate and easy to read. Includes all the parameters that you need to plan your session. Plus switch from daily view to hourly view with one tap of the screen.

- Do you plan your sessions around the moon phases? With our moon screen it’s super easy to find out when your favorite phase is going to occur. Just scroll the month and/or phase carousel and see the date appear. 

- Do you fish the rivers a lot? We’ve got the most comprehensive database that can call for live water level, drain, tide and temperature in an ever expanding list of countries. 

- We all know wind is a big factor in how smoothly a fishing day can go. With our wind animation it is super easy to see the direction of the wind in relation to the water’s edge. Skip through the forecast by simply sliding the cursor left or right instantly see the animation change in direction and wind speed.

com.rmit.cs_umc,Citizen science microclimate,WEATHER,A tool for measuring the microclimate around their homes and neighbourhood.,"The Urban Microclimate App will provide citizens with a simple tool for measuring the microclimate around their homes and neighbourhood. Citizens will be using this app in conjunction with the “citizen sensors”. A number of citizen sensors measuring temperature and humidity will be distributed amongst local communities in various Australian states. Citizens will be able to view the temperature and humidity of their locations along with the same for other “citizen sensors” across Australia that are connected through the app. Citizens can specify the attributes of their location, ranging from densely built urban area to green area; locations including park, car park; special features including proximity to water, shade, irrigated grass and wind conditions. Citizens can also take a picture or video of the location and upload through the app. In addition, a number of reference stations with high precision sensors are connected via this app. Citizens can review their results with reference to these stations and compare with the selected Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) weather stations.

This app is developed as part of a citizen science project that aim to work with local councils and citizens across Australia to design infrastructure for measuring urban heat island, overheating, and local climate change. The number of extreme hot days is predicted to increase significantly over the next few decades in all Australian cities with negative impacts on public health, mortality rates, energy demand and economy. Through this app that works in conjunction with the “citizen sensor”, citizens will get an understanding of the important parameters influencing the microclimate.  Through participating in various experiments, citizens will be well-informed to respond to extreme heat through an understanding of the influential factors (such as design features, greenery and materials) affecting the local urban microclimate and the ways to deal with the adverse effects from increased temperatures. The results from this study will provide data required for citizens to understand, mitigate and adapt to extreme heat. Better informed citizens can respond better to council’s climate change mitigation policies and climate change related legislations by the state and Federal Government. Ultimately it is hoped that citizens will be empowered and motivated to implement appropriate mitigation techniques to improve the microclimate in their home or neighbourhood."

app.fd.rainsat,Rain SAT,WEATHER,Is the rain coming?,"RAIN SAT is a WEATHER APP that allows you to easily consult the latest images from the most important meteorological satellites with a simple ""tap on screen"" to understand if a storm charged with rain is approaching in ITALY.

In fact, we must be wary of the forecasts, proposed by some sites, which vary in detail hour by hour. In fact, they are not possible with the current weather models.

For this reason, the forecasts we read do not always reflect what actually happens. This also depends on the fact that meteorology is currently a science based on probabilistic laws only.

The best thing is therefore to rely on real-time images from satellites that send us all the photos of our planet every day and that allow us to identify the movements of the rain and its possible path a few hours in advance.

This is the only way to identify the extent of the individual storm cells that make up the approaching cloud structure in the area that interests us.

Today the best reference for the Italian territory is constituted by the satellite network ""Meteosat"" which identifies a set of artificial geostationary meteorological satellites managed by ""EUMETSAT"" (European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites).

FREE version and continuously updated. The new version 2.0 is currently being tested with additional new useful services.

Sudden changes in the thermal environment (heat waves or cold spells) are also major health challenges for the elderly and other vulnerable populations, increasing mortality and morbidity. The consequences of thermal stress are dependent not only on climate factors, but also on individual human physiology and thermo-regulation capacity. For warning and preparation purposes, climate services can provide information on current and upcoming environmental conditions, but such weather forecasts will be much more valuable for individuals facing adverse weather conditions if combined with individual characteristics and translated into optimized adaptation strategies that can be provided and implemented immediately. 

The app uses your personal information (height, weight, age, gender) to calculate personalized coping strategies against thermal climate stress.

Within the next year the app will regularly be updated with new thermal models along with optimization of the current content.

edu.wisc.ssec.wxsat,WxSat,WEATHER,"WxSat displays and animates full-resolution, real-time weather satellite data.","WxSat (short for Weather Satellite) displays and animates full-resolution, real-time weather satellite data. WxSat leverages SSEC Data Center holdings to provide global coverage for visible, infrared, and water vapor channels.

Several geostationary and polar orbiting weather satellites around the globe continuously capture observations of the earth. These data are acquired by the SSEC Data Center which has one of the most extensive collections of real-time and archived weather satellite data in the world. A server dedicated to WxSat blends the images into single hourly global composites for three different products (Visible, Infrared, and Water Vapor). The server stages the most complete hourly images (backfilled when necessary) every hour at 36 minutes past the hour. This allows for a majority of the satellite sources to be included in the composites. These hourly composites are staged for WxSat and form the basis of the animations.

The names of the different images in WxSat refer to the parts of the electromagnetic spectrum the satellite sensors are sampling. The atmosphere is transparent to different types of radiation in certain areas of the spectrum called channels. The three most widely used atmospheric channels are the visible (0.6 microns), infrared (10 to 12 microns), and water vapor (6.5 to 6.9 microns). Scientist combine information provided from all three types of images to forecast the weather, monitor forest fires, ice flows, ocean currents, and long term climate patterns from the unique global perspective that only satellites can provide."

it.piemonte.arpa.meteo,Meteo 3R,WEATHER,Meteo 3R is the application of the official meteorology of the Italian north-west.,"Meteo 3R brings together the official meteorology of the Italian north-west in a single application.

It offers the possibility of consulting forecasts, observed data and alert messages in Piedmont, Valle d'Aosta and Liguria.

The forecasts are elaborated and validated by expert meteorologists and not by automatic algorithms; also for this reason they arrive at the third day without going further, when the reliability of the forecast drops significantly.

The data is in real time, based on the largest public network of weather stations calibrated and regularly maintained: from the temperature to the amount of rain, from wind speed to humidity, the main weather parameters are shown in the application.

It is also possible to consult the radar, the most effective tool to follow the movement of precipitation as it is developing.

The warning messages are the official ones, issued for possible natural hazards resulting from the weather conditions that could occur. Pay the utmost attention to potentially dangerous situations, adopting the self-protection measures indicated by the Civil Protection.

Meteo 3R was born from the collaboration of the 3 regions - Piedmont, Valle d'Aosta and Liguria - for 3 reasons - to observe, predict and alert.

The application was developed by Arpa Piemonte in cooperation with the Functional Center of the Valle d'Aosta Region, the Functional Center of Arpa Liguria and the Functional Center of Arpa Piemonte, as part of the RISK-COM project, section WP4 ""Awareness and resilience ""and of the RISK-ACT project, WP3 - Creation of a network of cross-border pilot sites, of the RISK Thematic Integrated Plan.

ru.mindarts.magnetology,Magnetology,WEATHER,Forecast of geomagnetic storms and the state of Earth´s geomagnetic field.,"«Magnetology» is an application which permits one to watch the forecast of geomagnetic storms and the state of Earth´s geomagnetic field. 

WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT? 

Geomagnetic storms adversely affect the health of humans. 

They can cause aches, dizziness, rapid heart rate, and abnormal blood pressure. 

People with abnormal conditions of the blood and of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems are particularly susceptible to the influence of geomagnetic storms. 

The degree of magnetic storms’ influence on a particular person depends on many factors, including health status, stress, physical and emotional fatigue, natural predisposition. 

Not only can geomagnetic storms have a negative impact on humans, but also on communications, navigation, and power. Drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are most vulnerable to impact of geomagnetic storms.

By taking into account the forecast of geomagnetic storms, you can plan difficult decisions, avoid high physical stress, and protect yourself from negative consequences. 

Our application will help you with this. 

ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE GEOMAGNETIC STORMS 

The Earth's geomagnetic field changes occur under the influence of the Sun. The intensity of the impact is not constant and depends on the ongoing processes on the solar surface. 

The strength of geomatic field disturbances is characterized by the value of Kp index. The Kp index can be assigned values from 0 to 9, where 0 is the absence of disturbances and 9 represents extremely strong perturbations of the earth´s geomagnetic field. 

Disturbances with a Kp index of 5 and above are called storms. 

The number of geomagnetic storms per year can reach 50!

There are three components to the project, the first component being updating the climate data basis and enhancing  data availability and accessibility of long-term and high-quality daily temperature and precipitation climate series  for China and Greece. The second component is to define the range of climate variability experienced, to examine  recent changes of extreme climate and to quantify the impact of climate change on fundamental meteorological  parameters, namely air temperature and precipitation. finally, the third component is to deliver a scientific synthesis  and visualization of modern climate conditions in Greece using homogeneous and spatially representative climatic  data and high-quality metadata. The objectives of this proposal will be achieved through the following actions: a)  collecting representative raw daily air temperature and precipitation data and metadata in both countries and  subjecting raw climate data to detailed quality control, b) applying state-of-the-art homogenization methods to all  available data of surface temperature and precipitation, c) calculating and updating the national climatological  normals based on homogenized data series d) applying spatial interpolation techniques, appropriate for  meteorological data, on homogenized temperature and precipitation series in order to correlate the meteorological  variables with various geospatial (geographic and topographic) factors such as terrain height, coastal effects,  orientation etc. and creating continuous surfaces from data points, e) cartographic representation of daily  temperature and precipitation using geographical information system (GIS) techniques, f)calculating appropriate  climate extreme indices so as to describe the state and the changes in the climate system from the past until now,  g) The expected result will be the development of a publicly available (free) gridded climate database for Greece and  China. This will allow the trend analysis of temperature and precipitation and their extremes up to present years for  the first time in Greece, resulting in findings concerning the climatic change impact in both countries up to now."

edu.umass.casa.casaalerts,CASA Alerts,WEATHER,CASA Alerts is a mobile app developed by the CASA Engineering Research Center.,"CASA Alerts delivers cutting-edge, hyper-local weather information about thunderstorms, tornados, hail, high winds and floods in the greater Dallas Fort Worth area to your mobile phone.  As severe weather occurs, you’ll receive customized alerts based on your preferences.  We’ll also send you periodic surveys to get your feedback on the alerts, the weather you are experiencing, and your general attitudes towards severe weather.  The surveys don’t require much extra effort on your part and will be used for research on improving the way weather information is delivered to people like you.  
 
CASA Alerts was developed by the CASA Engineering Research Center (http://www.casa.umass.edu/main/research/urbantestbed/research/), led by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, to improve user-centric, context-aware severe weather warnings using CASA’s City Warn™ platform.  This app is part of the CASA WX project that has brought innovative, high-resolution radar technology to the region.  CASA WX is a collaboration among several north Texas cities and towns, the North Central Texas Council of Governments, University of Massachusetts Amherst and Colorado State University.
 
Note: This app is designed to be a “tap on the shoulder” to keep you aware of risky weather near you and your loved ones.  The app identifies areas of risk and sends notifications based on your alerting preferences and important locations. The app does not display the full suite of CASA radar products, and therefore might not be suited for those seeking CASA radar data for detailed analysis.

The cooler and therefore, denser air, may make spray particles drift off target, often referenced as spray drift.  Because spraying during an air temperature inversion is in violation of label instructions, this app, once an inversion is detected, sends a push notification to the user informing them that spraying may longer be advisable.

Maps generated by this app are not interactive maps, but maps—usually PDFs—that are suitable for emailing and printing out on paper.

Depending on the availability of the flood study data in your area, this app will generate one of the following results:

• Areas with modern digital FEMA flood study data: A printable PDF showing about 400 acres or about 0.6 sq. mi.

<b>HAVING TROUBLE?</b>

This app requires having a PDF viewer app—such as the Adobe Acrobat Reader app—installed on your phone. Many phones have one installed already. You also need to have a web browser app installed, like Google Chrome or Firefox.

If the FEMA study data in your location is old, you'll need to have an app for opening zip files (such as Winzip) and an app for opening TIFF files (such as Multi-TIFF Viewer Free) so you can open the scanned maps that are used for those locations.

The forecasts for the first four days are made with the WRF numerical model (nested at the 12:00 UTC output of the GFS model) with a spatial resolution of 8 km.
From the fifth to tenth days from the consultation date, the app offers predictions framed in a range of uncertainty, with data related exclusively to temperature and precipitation, from the Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS).
In addition, predictions are shown for the following meteorological variables: temperature, precipitation, wind direction and speed, and humidity. It also includes information on sunrise and sunset times, moon phase and tides.

The prediction is of a general nature and does not apply correction techniques to the output of the model, except for a simple correction of the topography. Therefore, there may be systematic biases in some locations, especially in areas of complex orography. Likewise, it is important to take into account that the prediction of some phenomena is intrinsically uncertain. For example, it is not possible to predict the time and place where summer storms will hit.

To illustrate the precision and limitations of a prediction with this resolution, the validation section is maintained, which, using the AEMET observation network, allows the prediction of the last few days to be compared with the observed data. This evaluation is an option not available in other similar applications.

The TH-Code project, mainly developed out of Chennai, India, is aimed at dispensing with historic complications with communication caused by the problem with identifying various locations with their ""door number"", ""street name"", ""city"" and other neanderthal artifacts that currently clutters our heads (and our information storage systems), and usher us into the 21st century.

 At the present stage, you can use TH-Code to put a 21st century label on any location YOU can think of- if you can find it on a map, or if you have its latitude/longitude. It will also identify locations from their unique encoding- and help you find your way there via its seamless link to your favorite navigation software.

Haze is traditionally an atmospheric phenomenon where dust, smoke and other dry particles obscure the clarity of the sky. Though not a common occurrence in Singapore, it does still happen from time to time especially during the Southwest Monsoon season from June to September.
Haze@SG is useful utility that allows you to check the hourly Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) on the go. PSI is a measurement developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) which provides an accurate, timely and easily understandable indicator of daily levels of air pollution.

However, the 1-hour PM2.5 concentration levels can be volatile and tend to fluctuate over the day especially during periods of transboundary haze. Short-term fluctuations will also be very heavily influenced by weather conditions.

Features include:
- Access to hourly AQI Reading for better assessment of the air quality
- Access to hourly PM2.5 Reading
- Access to hourly PSI (24-hours, PM2.5 Concentration based) across Singapore from NEA on the go.
- Understand what the current PSI means to you
- Notification when PSI reaches unhealthy level.  Notification can be turned on and off as per your preference.
- Share the current AQI/PSI/PM2.5 with your friends and family and keep them informed and safe!

Note:
This app is developed without any involvement of NEA. Any inaccuracies found are not the responsibility of and should not be attributed to NEA.

Note: We are working very hard to make the app as reliable as possible before the haze season. Please always try to update to the latest version for the best user experience. If you have any feedback for us, please email to hosaystudios@gmail.com.  Thank you for supporting our apps."

Tired of all the conventional weather widgets that show a little sun a little clouds and temperature. 
Here is Widget that shows a meteogram instead. Much easier to see if there will be rain in the afternoon.

There is also an Application for those who do not want to run it as a widget. 

You can bookmark your current location. 

Auto update position option. Every time the widget updates (every 3 hours) it checks the location and show the widget for the current position (if option checked, off by default).

* REQUIREMENTS *: Internet connection and active location services are required to operate the application.

So before giving a negative evaluation on the application, always keep this concept in mind.

* N.B. *: The app is only available in Italian! The weather stations are amateur, and have been entered by their owners in the weather network of our portal. It is therefore possible that not all locations in Italy have a weather station available.

The invisible world of atmospheric aerosol particles is rendered into new views and experiences in augmented reality. Forms, colours and sounds change according to the current state of climate, moment by moment. Art travels everywhere with your device - Kairos² brings the critical events of climate change to your location.

The AR application is constantly powered by real-time scientific data of atmospheric aerosol particles. Each moment of Kairos² is unique because the concentration of aerosols changes very rapidly.

Kairos² is made as a collaboration between art, science and technology. The lifetime, size distribution and consistency of atmospheric aerosol particles play a crucial role in the research of climate change. The real- time data is provided by INAR – Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research.

Atmospheric aerosol particles are highly variable both temporally and spatially. Being the hyperflux of climate, yet their influence on the climate system remains partially obscure. Within the invisible, transparent and unknown, the present moment becomes a means to understand the continuous process of climate, and to create one’s own relationship with it.

Start interacting with the air particles by simply moving your device in any direction. When ‘air now’ flashes on screen, the number of aerosols has increased dramatically, whereas ‘slow now’ marks a decrease.

net.justdave.nwsweatheralertswidget,NWS Weather Alerts Widget,WEATHER,Home screen widget: displays weather alerts from the US National Weather Service,"This is an Android home screen widget to display current weather alerts from the US National Weather Service.

You can choose a county or state within the US (or the entire US) and it will display a list of all of the current weather alerts for that area on the widget. If there's more than fits, the list scrolls, and you can tap on an alert to open the full text of the alert. There is an accompanying app which can be used to configure what area you want and shows the raw feed data if you're really curious (though that part was mostly there for debugging, and might go away one of these days now that it all works). It does not currently do audible alerts (or any alerts), but that's probably coming soon.

I created this because I wanted a tablet on the wall in my kitchen to display weather alerts on the screen, and for all the plethora of weather apps out there, I couldn't find one that showed anything more than a (!) icon on their widgets for alerts, and you had to click through to find out what they were. Some of them would put the alerts into the notification bar, but that wasn't much better. So this one displays a list of the current alerts right on the widget, and that is the only purpose of the widget.

This application is open source. To report bugs, request new features, or If you'd like to help make it better, please visit the project page on GitHub at https://justdave.github.io/nwsweatheralertswidget/

Get the source code here: https://github.com/mtopolnik/weather-radar-hr

You get an auto-refreshed widget where you can see if there are any rains approaching your current location (the red dot). Tapping it takes you to the main screen with the radar imagery from two sources synchronously animated. Double-tap or pinch-zoom an animation to enter full-screen where you can zoom while the animation still runs. By using the seek bar you can seek to and hold any animation frame.

Above every image/animation is an indication of its age so you don't waste your time analyzing stale images. 

You can adjust the animation rate and the pause before repeating. Faster animation gives you a better sense of rain's movement so you can extrapolate into the future. Slower animation is better for precise analysis.

The app displays the animations published by the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service and the Slovenian Environment Agency. These are the best sources, “from the horse’s mouth”, for this region. 

The radar images, as published by their hosting agencies, contain their creation time, but in UTC so usually you have to translate that to your timezone. The app reads these times using OCR and does the translation for you, so above each image you can see its age and timestamp."

About 7Timer
------------
7Timer!, pronounced as ""Tri-Timer"", means ""bell of clear sky"" in Chinese. It is a series of meteorological forecast products. Most of the products base on a numeric weather model from NOAA/NCEP, called GFS, and aim on short-term (up to 16 days) weather forecast service for special purpose, for example, astronomical activities, or meteorological condition assessment. 7Timer! was first introduced in mid 2005 and has been revised for better fitting of public service operation in mid 2008. It's first designed as a weather forecast tool for astronomical purpose, as the author himself is a long-term astronomer and is always annoyed by fluky weather conditions."

Once seen, it is never forgotten. AuroraWatch UK allows you to monitor geomagnetic activity and will let you know when aurora MAY be visible from the UK.

Get alerts about increases in geomagnetic activity - triggered when the AuroraWatch status level changes; this indicates the relative likelihood of viewing an aurora in the UK.

Read last 24 hours recent history.
30 minute forecast model from SWPC.

Please email aurora@smallbouldering.com with any issues.

PLEASE NOTE:
Phone settings such as Battery Saver which limit the phone getting push notifications will narrow or even close the aurora alert window.
The app does not alert historically.  If your phone is off or unable to connect to the internet when the status goes up but the level goes back down before the next data update you will receive no alert.
There is a necessary delay before alerts are sent since the data needs to 'settle down' as recommended by Lancaster University.
The alerts provided by Lancaster University tend to default to their Lancaster magnetometer for alerting though they do have others; most importantly one in Shetland.  Naturally there is a greater chance of seeing an Aurora in Shetland but since that data is not (usually) used alerts are a little more 'pessimistic'.  This is appropriate for those of us living in England but less so for those further north.

The AuroraWatch UK (Android) app is developed and maintained by Smallbouldering Projects, it is not an 'Official' app.
AuroraWatch UK alerts data is provided by Lancaster University, UK using data from the SAMNET and/or AuroraWatchNet magnetometer networks:  Read more about this here:

Our hourly PSI figures are calculated using NEA's hourly reading. Unlike others, we don't use our own sensors which may or may not be calibrated correctly or accurate.

All images are unified to the same format for easy comparison. You can zoom out and see a general mosaic of all the radars, or select a particular radar to observe the detailed weather situation in real time. In addition, satellite imagery, lightning (subscription required), and weather alerts and warnings from Argentina, Uruguay, Brasil and Spain can be added.

I enabled resizing which works fine on my Lenovo tablet but people are complaining about it not working on their phone. The widget is already four icons wide and the ratio of the screen is what it is. If your phone is also four icons wide, your options are, of course, limited. If you have an idea what you want, tell me what it is and I'll probably see if I can implement it. Otherwise, as far as I'm aware, resizing works as expected and simply complaining won't help anyone.

br.com.austn.irrigatorpro,Irrigator Pro,WEATHER,Irrigation scheduling,"Irrigator Pro provides growers of peanuts, cotton, and corn with a simple tool to determine when to irrigate to ensure optimal crop growth while minimizing irrigation costs.

These irrigation recommendations are based on long-term, multi-crop irrigation management research performed by the ARS National Peanut Research Laboratory in Dawson, GA.

Irrigator Pro calculates the available water in the soil and the daily water needs of the crop based in its growth stage. If the water needs of the crop exceeds the available water in the soil, irrigation is recommended.

Irrigator Pro can estimate the available soil water content using:

○ Manually entered rainfall and irrigation data,
○ Manually entered values from soil water potential or volumetric water content sensors,
○ Soil water potential sensors values wireless transmitted to the University of Georgia (UGA) data repository,
○ Soil water potential sensors values from UGA Probe and Bridge device,
○ Soil water potential sensors values from Trellis - Wireless Soil Moisture System, or
○ Volumetric water content sensors values from AgSense - Wireless Soil Moisture System.

Irrigator Pro notifies users on irrigation needs and crop phenological changes.

com.interneers.tafsmetars,TAFsMETARs,WEATHER,Free App to provide access to Aviation Info for enthusiasts and pilots alike.,"Access TAF and METAR data in real-time. Aviation weather reports/observations and forecasts are a cornerstone to safe flying around the globe.

Built for simplicity and speed of information flow, this version uses International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) identifier codes to search for information and displays them as text, no whizzy maps to download or render, simply information as quick and easy as possible.

Meteorological Aviation Report (METAR) is a format for reporting weather information. A METAR weather report is predominantly used by pilots in fulfilment of a part of a pre-flight weather briefing, and by meteorologists, who use aggregated METAR information to assist in weather forecasting.

Raw METAR is the most popular format in the world for the transmission of weather data. It is highly standardized through ICAO, which allows it to be understood throughout most of the world.

In meteorology and aviation, TAF is a format for reporting weather forecast information, particularly as it relates to aviation. ""TAF"" is an acronym of Terminal Aerodrome Forecast or, in some countries, Terminal Area Forecast. TAFs apply to a five statute mile radius from the centre of the airport runway complex. Generally, TAFs can apply to a 9- or 12-hour forecast; some TAFs cover an 18- or 24-hour period; and as of November 5, 2008, TAFs for some major airports cover 30 hours periods

com.iittp.air,AiR - Pollution Visualizer,WEATHER,Use Augmented Reality to visualize the air quality around you.,"AiR for android has been designed and developed in order to provide the public with an easier way to visualize the pollution around them and gain a clearer picture before the levels rise to a point that it negatively impacts lives but cannot be reversed anymore.
Air Pollution refers to the release of foreign particles into the atmosphere which is harmful to our health and the planet as a whole. This has been a subject of concern and intense study in recent years due to the deteriorating air quality. 
A large number of programs have been put in place to check on the ever-rising pollution levels.  Success of any nation in implementing such programs depends on the support of its subjects. Bringing awareness plays a major role in garnering this support. The current advances in AR Technology has allowed for greater ways of making the intangible objects like pollutants tangible.
AiR aims at spreading awareness in an interactive way about the different pollutants, their sources, and health impacts. It allows data to be easily understood by the public and inspire or aid further studies into preserving the beauty of our planet.

The best time to manage white mold is during flowering (R1 and R2 growth stages) when apothecia (small, mushroom-like structures) are present on the soil surface. Apothecia release spores which infect senescing soybean flowers, leading to the development of white mold. University research has indicated that the appearance of apothecia can be predicted using several variables including weather and amount of soybean row closure in a field. Based on this research, models have been developed to forecast the risk of apothecia being present in a soybean field. Farmers can easily input site-specific information about their soybean field into this app, which combines this information with the research-based models to predict the best timing for white mold treatment."

■ The forecast is not correct.
  - The forecast is not 100% certain as the predicted probability, and it is becoming more difficult to make a forecast with a high accuracy as extreme weather conditions due to abnormal weather become more severe. In case of severe weather changes, please take turns reading the K-Weather and Meteorological Agency forecasts to prepare for the change.

■ Information is not updated.
- Updates may be delayed intermittently during rush hour and hourly hours when traffic is high. In this case, please try pressing the refresh button or relaunch the app after 1-2 minutes.

■ The aspect ratio is strange.
- For some terminal users, the resolution ratio does not match, so it may be inconvenient to use the application. Please note that if you check System Settings > Screen > Aspect Ratio Calibration > Applicable app, it will be displayed in the normal aspect ratio.

Well, let the FuWeather app do that for you. It will check the weather and show it in a very special way…

Features:
Funny weather – you're going to have a smile on your face while the app will be complaining and swearing about the weather, 
Accurate current conditions,
Hour-by-hour weather,
Two-week forecast (detailed, of course)
Weather maps (radar, satellite, temperature, humidity, wind)*,
Home screen widgets**,
Optional weather notifications**.

Everything served in a sarcastic, sharp-tongued (and sometimes even humorous) manner.

Fully customizable. You can adjust the colors, your temperature preference, add own sayings (or those submitted by other users), and much more. 

The app was previously called ""Fu*** Weather (Funny Weather)"". The name changed, the humor stays the same (and so does everything else)!

Warning:
The app contains strong language. Lots of swearing, cursing, and other profane words. Not politically correct. If you easily get offended, perhaps you should just watch the TV forecast and not bother me.

This danger is materialized by a color of raw vigilance to which bulletins and forecasts are associated.

This application, managed by the State services, is free and provides the following information:
- raw alertness level (green/yellow/orange/red);
- national and local information bulletins written by flood forecasters, and behavior advice adapted to the situation;
- water levels and/or flows observed in watercourses
- forecasts of water levels and/or flows at certain stations, in a flood situation;
- maps of flood zones in certain sectors.

The application makes it possible to geolocate on the map and to visualize the sections of rivers and the stations nearby.
The application also allows you to create a personal account to benefit from personalized subscriptions and warnings.
Subscriptions allow you to receive a notification each time a newsletter is published.
Warnings allow you to receive notifications when there is a change in the color of flood vigilance on a section of watercourse, a territory, or a department; and to receive notifications when the level of the stream exceeds the threshold chosen by the user on a station.

*** New arrivals ***
The application makes it possible to geolocate on the map and to visualize the sections of rivers and the stations nearby.
For stations selected as favourites, the value of the last measurement is displayed.

nl.maris.seamobile,SeaMobile: Cyprus,WEATHER,SeaMobile: Cyprus provides a guide to the weather of the beaches of Cyprus.,"The SeaMobile App provides a handy and dynamic guide to the beaches and marine waters of Cyprus. It gives for each beach local information (description and features), marine forecasts (waves, currents, temperature, salinity and winds) and weather forecasts. This is provided in tables and maps, including animations.

The information aims at users in the tourism and recreational sectors, in particular public visiting beaches, swimming, surfing, sailing, fishing, and diving, and professionals such as hotels, schools for diving, surfing, sailing, fishery trips organizers, boat rentals, and others.

The marine forecasts are updated daily with a forecast horizon of 3 days and include the sea currents, sea temperature and salinity, sea level, offshore significant wave height, swell, tides, as well as winds over the sea. These are derived from the operational coastal ocean forecasting and observing system (CYCOFOS) that is operated by the Oceanography Center of the University of Cyprus (OC-UCY). This Center conducts basic and applied research in the fields of ocean physics and dynamics, remote sensing, operational oceanography, and biological and chemical oceanography. It collects marine monitoring data by in-situ instruments and by satellites, which are used in CYCOFOS, and it cooperates with existing operational ocean forecasting networks in Europe. 

The SeaMobile App has been developed by OC-UCY in cooperation with MARIS (Netherlands), WabbieWorks (Cyprus), and the Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO). The App allows public to appreciate the power and changeability of the sea at many scales and in many aspects. The information services can also increase safety, because users will be warned of possible high waves or heavy currents and take these into account when planning their activities such as sailing, diving, boat trips and others. 

The SeaMobile App adds flavour to the services that are already offered to tourists and make Cyprus even more attractive as a holiday destination. 

The SeaMobile project is co-funded by the Repubic of Cyprus and the European Regional Development Fund. The SeaMobile information service is developed for giving tourist and recreational users access to customised marine data and forecasting services, adopting smart phones and mobile touch screen devices as distribution platforms. Later this might be expanded with dedicated services for businesses and public authorities."

com.microsys.SolarRadiation,Solar Radiation,WEATHER,This app displays the most common indices for solar radiation measurements.,"Here is a nice application that displays the instant and the mean values of the most important indices related to the solar irradiance. This accurate measuring tool (portrait orientation, Android 6 or newer) works on the tablets, phones and smartphones that are connected to the Internet. At first, it gets the local coordinates (latitude and longitude) from your device's GPS and then retrieves those parameters from an Internet server. There are five important parameters that show the amount of solar radiation received per square meter:
 
Shortwave Radiation - GHI - is equal to the total Global Horizontal Irradiation;
Direct Radiation - DIR - is the amount of direct solar radiation on the horizontal plane;
Diffuse Radiation - DIF - is the amount of diffuse solar radiation that come equally from all directions;
Direct Normal Irradiance - DNI - is the amount of direct radiation received on a surface perpendicular to the position of the Sun;
Terrestrial Radiation - TER - is the amount of outgoing longwave radiation emitted by the Earth's surface to space.

The GHI parameter is actually the sum of DIR and DIF. All of these indices are provided for the current day, but there are 7-day forecasts for all indices, both instant and average values.
The sum of all GHI hourly indices can be used to calculate the total energy received by each square meter of your solar panels. This value includes their efficiency and other energy losses that occur during conversion to electricity.

Features:

-- instant display of the solar radiation indices at current location

The user enters the sensor ID to select the proper sensor. This is required in the event that more than one Etesian Bluetooth Smart sensor is located within range of the iPhone.

In photography the golden hour translates into soft light, warm colors, shadows so long that they tend to disappear and a good level of contrast despite the reduced dynamics. Its opposite is the Blue hour that identifies a specific condition of the solar light characterized by a colder temperature and a low energy, which, in practical terms, results in subjects with numerous penumbra, de-saturated and colder colors and intense blue sky. The golden hour occurs when the sun is very low on the horizon and therefore in the moments after sunrise and before sunset, the blue hour instead at sunset or sunrise, in twilight situation, when the sun it's below the horizon. The time, duration and intensity of these ""magical hours"" change according to the seasons, latitudes and weather conditions and therefore this app will help you to identify them perfectly."

The forecasts refer to the superficial layer of the sea.
The speed is expressed in nodes and the ""+"" and ""-"" signs refer respectively to the ""upstream current"" and to the ""downward current"".
The time of the ""tired"" is the moment when the intensity of the current is equal to zero.
The times are indicated taking into account the Italian time, solar or legal, depending on the time of year, so they do not need corrections.
The app calculates the direction and the speed of the current at the reference sea gauges of ""Punta Pezzo"" and ""Punta Ganzirri"". For the other localities of the Strait, called secondary localities "", there are some calculation methods reported in the aforementioned publication.

WARNING: The result of the calculation of astronomical tide currents may differ from the actual sea conditions due to the effects of the meteorological conditions in progress.

co.smart.solarthermal,Solar Thermal,WEATHER,Generating power from solar thermal system.,"For generating power from solar thermal system, radiation from the Sun is concentrated to get high temperature (~200-1000 C). This high temperature is used to generate electricity. Here our APP shows the solar thermal power generation estimated at different locations of India based on the Parabolic Trough Collector technology. The simulation is carried out for 1 MW installed Capacity as a unit for Solar thermal  Power plant. In our APP, initially, the user taps on the chosen location over a google map. Then the APP provide the details of Latitude, Longitude, name of the location and energy potential month wise in the form a table with numbers showing the energy values. 


The target of the National Solar Mission is to build up India as a worldwide pioneer in solar energy generation. Solar power can be transmitted through grid either from solar photovoltaic or solar thermal technology. As compared to solar photovoltaic, solar thermal installations are less studied, especially regarding energy estimation and performance analysis. For estimating the potential of CSP plants, it is planned to simulate a power plant. We have marginally modified the design of 1 MW operational power plant installed at Gurgaon using Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) technology. The results are compared with the expected output of Gurgaon power plant and also 50 MW power plant at Rajasthan. Our results have closely matched with a small deviation of 3.1% and 3.6% for Gurgaon and Rajasthan plants, respectively. Our developed model is also validated with 18 different solar power plants in different parts of the world by slightly modifying the parameters according to the plant capacity without changing major changes to the plant design. Difference between our results and the expected energy generation varied from 0.4% to 13.7% with an average deviation of 6.8%. As our results show less than 10% deviation as compared to the actual generation, an attempt has been made here to estimate the potential for the entire nation. For this modelling has been carried out for every grid station of 0.25° × 0.25° interval in India.

0 - 50: (Good) - Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.
51 - 100: (Moderate) - Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.
101 - 150: (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) - Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected.
151 - 200 (Unhealthy) - Everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.
201 - 300 (Very Unhealthy) - Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected.

com.evilgreven.okquakes,OKQuakes,WEATHER,OKQuakes is your one-stop app for recent Oklahoma earthquakes.,"This app requires internet access to function, as it pulls the data from the University of Oklahoma's earthquake list on the web.  As of 1.07, the app also requests data from USGS. This list isn't always up-to-date with earthquakes; from what I can gather, there are some limitations to OU's automated list.

Based on my own observations, it seems that OU's computers only add larger earthquakes automatically, while smaller earthquakes may need to be manually added by seismologists when they review the list (hence usually less reported earthquakes on the weekends).

This app is NOT an automated app (the user must run the app to obtain the list), NOR does it store any data on the device after execution, save for the new user tracker (used by tutorial) in version 1.05+.

Features of this app:
*Converts the time from UTC to your device's time settings.
*Google Maps integration to show where earthquakes on the list are in the State of Oklahoma.
*Color-coded pins for earthquake strengths.
*Click-able list of earthquakes (with color-coded magnitudes) to bring up the Google Maps location.
*Menu access to view all quakes on the list or just those in the last 24 hours.
*Estimated earthquake intensity radius per: B. Gutenberg and C. F. Richter. ""Earthquake magnitude, intensity, energy, and acceleration: (Second paper)."" Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, April 1956. 46:105-145.

This Application covers all these aspects in order to manage the various disasters and also to compensate the affected peoples.  The application also provides an “official alert” system for a disaster entails the coordination between management and affected. The emergency coordinator will therefore activate the required humanitarian plan. It provides a SOS facility and tracking of the personal in need. Mobile app also provides information and tracking of various relief material used during disaster with warehouse management along with return inventory tracking. The application provides all the details related to disaster and compensation management at fingertip."

Not only will these create rough conditions on the lake but if you are caught unprepared, the winds can knock down sailboats.

Windy Lookout analyzes and processes many current wind conditions beyond the perimeter of the lake to give users an early alert should a dangerous wind arise. We process this information in real-time to give users an alert allowing them to make the necessary decisions to stay safe in the minutes before the wind hits."
ru.alekseevsoft.climatsens_free,ClimatSensFree,WEATHER,"ClimatSensFree shows the Temperature, Humidity, Pressure on the screen.","The animation widget of ClimatSensFree shows the local environment Temperature, Humidity, Atmospheric pressure on the screen. You have a newest Samsung Galaxy  S4 or Samsung Galaxy  Note 3, it has the newest sensors, but you can not understand how to use it? It's very easy now! 

Attention! It is intended for the devices having the sensor of temperature humidity and a barometer.

You can change the displayed units because the app allows to change some settings. 
The affordable units are:
Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees (for the temperature)
A percentage (Humidity)
Millibars, millimeters or inches of mercury (The atmospheric pressure) 
The data value can be rounded to the nearest whole.You can turn on or turn off the animation.
 
The most important thing in design was the widget's ""lightness"" for easy information reading and, at the same time, did not have to take a lot of useful  space  of the desktop.
 That's why I used the clear glass imitation for the ClimatSens visualisation.
Due to this, the widget looks good on any desktop wallpaper. I paid special attention to App low power consumption during the development.
 When the screen is off the application goes into standby mode, which favorably affects the energy consumption.

Our History
We bring a long and proud tradition of innovation in the weather industry. We were founded in 1946 by John Murray and Dennis Trettel, two trailblazers who sought to provide the industry with something it never had before: accurate, site-specific forecasts on a real-time basis.

Today, our services benefit a broad range of businesses and industries, including energy companies, attorneys, snow/ice removal contractors, landscapers, entertainment facilities, sports venues, film production crews, insurers, manufacturers, government agencies and more.

be.inet.rainwidget,Meteo Weather Widget,WEATHER,A detailed weather forecast at a glance on your home screen,"<i>Meteo Weather Widget</i> is a weather app showing the weather in a very detailed way at a glance on your home screen. While many weather apps are showing the weather forecast in a rather basic way, this app does that by visualizing the forecast in a so-called <i>meteogram</i>. Doing so shows you a much better overview of when exactly rain will fall, the sun will be shining, when it will become cloudy...


The main focus of the app consists in showing the meteogram on a small home screen widget (e.g. a 4X1 widget). Even while the widget does not occupy that much space on the home screen, it still manages showing the forecast in a clear way. Simply add a widget on your home screen, specify your location (or let the widget automatically determine your location) and the weather forecast appears on your home screen.


The meteogram shows the temperature and expected precipitation for the complete forecast period. Besides those weather elements, the wind speed, wind direction and air pressure can also be visualized on the meteogram. The user has all freedom to customize how the meteogram should look like.


<b>Feature overview</b>:


• Temperature, precipitation, wind and pressure
• Cloudiness / clearness indication
• Short-term forecast (next 24 or 48 hours)
• Short-term forecast for the next 5 days
• Fully customizable: colors, graph settings, ...

A ""donate"" version of the app adds below features:

• Widget providing a long-term forecast (<i>next 10 days</i>) 
• Show humidity percentage
• Show sunrise and sunset
• Better (temperature) graph visualization (f.e. color the graph in blue when the temperature falls below freezing, custom line thickness and style, ...)
• Show moon phase
• Show wind chill
• Feature allowing you to save current settings as default settings
• Enable (paid) weather provider(s) (as in-app subscription)
• For the United States only: NOAA as weather provider


<b>About the weather forecast data</b>

All thanks to MET.NO (The Norwegian Meteorological Institute) for offering the weather forecast data (notice that for the long-term forecast period, one of the best weather models - ECMWF - is used by MET.NO).

For locations in the United States, NOAA is offered as short term weather provider.

origo.weathixcpro,Aero XC : weather for flying,WEATHER,Weather forecast with high vertical profile. For flying and professionals.,"Weather forecast with an extensive vertical profile. For flying and professionals.

Do you want to know what the wind will blow at height or at the ground?
Would you like to go soaring or are you looking for proper thermals? 
Do you fly paragliding, rogalo or ultralight or maybe with something bigger?
Then this application is for you.

Aero XC displays forecast information as easily as possible.

In a clear vertical profile from the ground up to a height of about 12 km, the basic parameters such as force (color scale is adapted to flying) and wind direction, gusts and temperature, humidity and dew point are displayed.

Furthermore, the power and height of instability, convection condensation level, zero isotherm and clouds of all floors on a scale. The cloud floors are color-coded and correspond to the clouds on the map.
A new feature is the indication of the inverse level, which can affect the thermal flow.
Everything can be zoomed in the range from about 2km to about 12km above sea level.
To obtain the vertical profile of a particular place simply hold your finger over any place or maps of the airport or the starting area.

On the map, you can view the different levels you need or look at the extent of unstable areas or simply rely on the map usability.
The map shows gusts both absolute and relative, which is the difference between the basic wind and the gust and is more suitable for flying. 
A distinctive Jet Stream map is intended for professionals.
You can display clouds on maps separately or combine them for each floor. The Cape index allows you to make the most of the day while avoiding storms.

There is a map of pressure units and for the USA and its surroundings we also have a map of queues.
The bottom bar then shows schematically the basic characteristics of the day.
There are thousands of airports and start-faces, you can select them on map or from the online list.
The sun card tells you when to land, unless you are flying IFR. :)
There are 3 prediction models available and further improvements are being worked on.

(3)	The detailed advisory and precautions are added. To make it more attractive, an animated Flag boy is added who will change the color of flag based on the quality of air from Green to Maroon. The expression of boy will also change and Flag gets lifted up as Air Quality worsens.
Many of you raised an issue as to why this service is available in just 4 cities and not in other cities. I share your concern and deeply appreciate. However, expanding such services requires lot of financial resources and time. One SAFAR station requires minimum cost towards 10 AQMS, 10 AWS, super computer cost for forecast, emission inventory cost, outreach cost and so on. Depending on priority, projects are approved. We expect to expand it in future but not in near future as it stands."

app.weathex.android,WeatheX - Weather Extremes Rep,WEATHER,Crowdsourced Extreme Weather Reports,"Welcome to the WeatheX app!

WeatheX needs you, the citizen scientist, to watch and report severe weather events wherever you are using your smartphone.

Severe weather events are often missed by weather instruments and are difficult to capture. Why? Because weather radar cannot see close to the ground and surface weather stations are sparsely located. Your reports will vastly improve our ability to capture these events and contribute to better understanding.

WeatheX allows you to report the severity, location and timing of hail size, wind damage, flooding and tornadoes. You can also capture a photo or add a description of the event. This information will be used by weather and climate researchers, including the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, Monash University and Australian Bureau of Meteorology. All reports and photos will remain anonymous and no identifying information is collected.

The app also allows you to view the location and time of recent reports across Australia. Zoom, pan and investigate what's happening locally or the other side of the country. You will also see your own report on the map immediately after reporting too!

To get started with reporting, download and open the WeatheX, select the + button on the map and choose a weather type. Please provide a description if possible, or if you need to report a previous event.

Weather forecast + Customized alerts = Wealert","Forecasts are a bunch of ever-changing variables. The forecast for tomorrow might be different when you check it in the morning from when you check it at night. Sometimes you may forget to check the forecast, and a lot of times you may only care if it's going to rain.


How is this different to a regular weather forecast app?
With Wealert you will never have to consciously check the forecast anymore! Rather than you checking the forecast for a particular time, Wealert automatically alerts you based on time and thresholds.

For example: I want to be alerted every morning at 8am only if the probability of rain at 5pm is greater than 40%.


Wealert allows you to set schedules on when the forecast for a particular time should automatically be checked:
- Customize whether you would only like to receive notifications if a particular threshold is exceeded (e.g. rain probability is greater than 30%, or temperature is above 34 degrees).
- Customize where you want the forecasts to be based on.
- Customize the occurrence of forecasts (e.g. every Thursday, or specific date in the future)
- Customize how long before a time you want to schedule the check (e.g. 2 hours before 9AM).

- Temperature (and apparent temperature)
- Precipitation (rain, snow, etc)

SafeWaters.AI is leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to generate shark attack risk forecasts. Our unique AI model, trained on over 200 years of attack and marine weather data, generates a 7 day risk forecast at any beach in the world.

Now when you’re checking the weather forecast & the surf forecast prior to heading to the beach, you can check the shark forecast as well.
Simply:
-          Search your desired beach location. We recommend using the actual beach name + another location identifier such as state, region, country, etc. For example:  New Smyrna Beach, FL or Bondi Beach, Australia.
-          View the current day or 7 day forecast.
-          Save your favorite locations for quick access and current day forecast previews on home screen
-          It’s that simple.

We enable swimmers, surfers, and beachgoers to assess their risk, allowing them to make informed decisions about entering the water. Authorities can also plan their staffing according to our risk forecasts, ensuring optimal safety measures are in place.

In addition to our innovative risk forecasting feature, SafeWaters.AI is committed to ocean conservation. We pledge to donate 5% of our profits towards ocean cleanup and conservation efforts.

PLEASE NOTE:  SafeWaters.AI does not predict shark attacks but provides risk forecasts based on past data. Always exercise your judgment and take necessary precautions when entering the water. Our service is an informational resource designed to aid your personal safety decisions. A “High Risk” day is a day where the conditions (40 marine weather variables), location, and date line up to previous attacks. We disclaim liability for any harm or loss occurring despite the indicated risk level. Risk forecasts are not infallible, outliers and unanticipated attacks can occur. Always exercise your own judgment and take necessary precautions. Your use of SafeWaters.AI signifies your understanding and acceptance of these terms."

co.smart.windtest,Wind Energy,WEATHER,Wind can be used energy for betterment of the mankind,"It is well known from the history that wind can be usedvas energy for betterment  of the mankind. With new technology, wind can be used for electrical power generation. As of now, wind speed information is available in different locations. However, the power generation from wind, is not readily available to the user. Here wind turbine at a fixed height of 75 meters is used to simulate energy potential in different locations of India and the data is made easily available to the potential developers through this APP with monthly potential in the form of a table.

The gap between energy demand and its generation is constantly widening. People have started giving more emphasis on renewable sources of energy. This paper presents the estimation of potential for wind energy generation maps based on fixed wind turbine capacity. Although wind energy has developed substantially in recent years, we have only wind speed and wind potential density maps. Our attempt here is to generate wind energy generation potential maps. Major step in achieving this goal is modeling of wind energy conversion system using TRNSYS software. The model consists of three main components namely the weather, the turbines and energy conversion parameters. The weather data are provided from the meteorological database, namely Meteonorm. The simulated output is compared with actual wind generation of wind farms. After comparing our model results with the existing wind energy generation data, we have extended to compute the wind energy generation for all locations in India. For simulation, 4691 locations are identified considering 0.25° × 0.25° interval. The energy generation simulated data are compiled and developed into maps that are useful to all wind energy developers. The data generated and presented in the form of maps are for all the 30 states of India. More details can  be seen from DOI: 10.4236/jpee.2016.410002"

gr.omikronsa.sealoc,Sealoc - your sea weather,WEATHER,Mapped projections  of scientific phenomena and weather in the Mediterranean sea,"Sealoc is an innovative platform, delivering map renderings in high resolution of maritime-forecast datasets. The Sealoc application presents  forecast maps on the Mediterranean Sea  and delivers high resolution data of the Greek Seas.  

We provide the following datasets:

1. Wind speed and direction forecast (in-house calculation).
2. Prediction of sea waves (wavewatch3 model)
3. Direction and speed  of surface waves (Copernicus marine)
4. Prediction of sea surface salinity (Copernicus marine)
5. Sea surface and underwater temperature forecast (Copernicus marine)
6. Seabed temperature forecast (Copernicus marine)
7. Forecast of sea surface elevation (Copernicus marine)
8. Prediction of dissolved oxygen in the water (Copernicus marine)
9. Prediction of nitrates concentration in the water (Copernicus marine)
10. Prediction of phosphates concentration in the water  (Copernicus marine)
11. Prediction of carbon concentration as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in the water (Copernicus marine).
12. Prediction of surface and underwater currents (upto 203m, Copernicus marine)

Additional cartographic layers are made available following  a simple registration process for  swimming, surfing  and sailing  use. When 'tapping' on a map,  location-specified data gets projected.Our data resolution  in the Aegean Sea is 2x2 kms, 6x6 kms in the remaining Greek seas - and 18x18kms in the Mediterranean sea space.

The project is financed by European and Greek national funds (Cycle A, EPANEK 2014-2020) and is implemented by two companies, Omikron Environmental Consultants SA and Draxis Environmental Technologies SA -- with Omikron being the lead partner and responsible for the implementation of the Sealoc platform.

The system presents both in-house generated forecasts, as well as external data forecasts from the European Base Copernicus Marine Service.

The in-house forecast models (wind speed forecast, sea ​​surface wave forecast) are being calculated by servers  of the  two beneficiary companies; calculations are  executed daily, deliverering a forecast window of three (3) days and a forecast time step of one (1) hour.
 
The external forecast data comes from the European database Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS).  Datasets are derived  both from satellite sources and  computer models.  A time forecast period of three (3) days is utilized -- and an hourly or daily forecast  step, depending on the associated forecast variable involved.

Supported platforms include mobile phones and tablets.
